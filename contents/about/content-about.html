<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    The Singapore Government Design System (SGDS) was developed to empower
    teams in creating fast, accessible and mobile-friendly digital services,
    with a common set of UI components that comply with the
    <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/digital-service-standards/">Digital Service
    Standards</a>. As the web constantly evolves, the Government must match
    evolving user expectations to deliver high-quality digital services.

<h3>Where to use SGDS</h3>

<div class="sgds-box">
    <h4>Static Informational Websites</h4>
    <p>A static site is the most basic website, and the easiest to build. It
        requires no server-side processing, serving only client-side content in the form of HTML pages
        (and optionally CSS and JavaScript) to users' browsers or mobile phones.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.isomer.gov.sg/">Isomer</a></strong> is an informational website
        generator created by the Government
        Technology Agency of
        Singapore (GovTech). It provides templates for websites based on SGDS, allows users to easily
        edit website content, provides hosting and is compliant to
        applicable clauses in the Instruction Manual 8 (IM8), Design Service Standard (DSS) and
        Usability Checklist (UC).</p>

<div class="sgds-box">
    <h4>Dynamic Informational Websites</h4>
    <p>
        Similar to static sites, dynamic websites serve client-side content.
        The difference, however, is that it uses a server and database to
        generate such client-side content on the fly, before serving them to
        user devices.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, WordPress sites commonly make use of PHP programs together
        with MySQL as a database to serve dynamically-generated content to users.
        They also support user logins for content writers. For this reason,
        dynamic websites tend to be more complicated and costly to build.
    </p>

      <strong>
        <a href="https://www.xtremax.com/discover-cwp">
          Content Website Platform(CWP)</a>
      </strong> is a common secured website building and serving platform.
      It provides a suite of standardised software for hosting content-based
      websites. It enables unclassified government websites to be
      centrally managed and operated in the public cloud.

<div class="sgds-box">
    <h4>Transactional Websites</h4>
    <p>A transactional website is a full-scale website that allows users to perform transactions, for
        example online banking or retail purchases. Government transactional sites typically allow users
        to interact with government services digitally, such as HDB or CPF.</p>
    <p>Transactional sites are usually built by vendors, who are encouraged to leverage on SGDS to
        deliver the best user experience.</p>

<h3>
    Our Core Principles
</h3>
<p>
    We constantly keep these core principles in mind when making design decisions
    at SGDS.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Clarity:</b> Easy to understand and navigate. Elements highlight
    important content and improve interactivity.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Efficiency:</b> Optimised workflows that help you to deliver the highest
    quality government websites to the public easily.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Consistency:</b> By using standard text styles, icons and interface
    elements, consistent government branding is achieved. This strengthens
    users’ intuition when interacting with different government services.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Reusable:</b> Eliminate the hassle of recreating basic components and
    patterns for every new product. SGDS houses a comprehensive collection of
    design components for you. These tried-and-tested assets reflect the
    industry’s best practices.

<h3>Why use a design system?</h3>
<p>A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear
  standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.
  It enables teams to build better products more quickly at scale using
  reusable designs.
</p>
<p>This concept is well-explained by Brad Frost through <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/"
        target="_blank">Atomic Design</a>
    from Brad Frost:</p>
<table class="table">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-atom is-size-5"></span></td>
            <td>Atoms</td>
            <td>The basic building blocks, for e.g. form label, an icon or a button</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-molecule is-size-5"></span></td>
            <td>Molecules</td>
            <td>Groups of atoms bonded together to do one thing</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-organism is-size-5"></span></td>
            <td>Organisms</td>
            <td>Groups of molecules joined together to form a complex section of an interface</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-template is-size-5"></span></td>
            <td>Templates</td>
            <td>Groups of organisms stitched together to form pages</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="sgds-icon sgds-icon-page is-size-5"></span></td>
            <td>Pages</td>
            <td>Pages are specific instances of templates. These are what end users ultimately see
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  Atomic design comprises designs spanning from abstract to concrete.
  Because of this, we can create products that are visually consistent,
  yet retain distinctive features. And by assembling rather than deconstructing,
  we are crafting an efficient design system to help you save time and effort.
