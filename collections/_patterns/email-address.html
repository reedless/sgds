<h3>Guidelines</h3>

<h4>Explain the rationale of requesting for usersâ€™ email address</h4>
<p>This allows users to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Feel assured that their email address will not be misappropriated</li>
    <li>Choose which email address they prefer to use</li>
</ul>

<h4>Make sure it works for all users</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
      Your field text should accommodate the maximum length of email addresses
      (256 characters long, including punctuation)
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Guide users to enter their email address</h4>
<p>Make it easier for users by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allowing them to copy and paste their email address</li>
    <li>
        Setting the <code>type</code> attribute to <code>email</code> so that
        the correct keyboard is displayed
    </li>
    <li>
        Setting the <code>spellcheck</code> attribute to <code>false</code> so
        that their email addresses are not spell checked by the browser or device
    </li>
    <li>
        Setting the <code>autocomplete</code> attribute so that browsers can
        fill in their email address if they have entered it previously
    </li>
    <li>You will need to include the <code>autocomplete</code> attribute to meet
        <a
            href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html"
            target="_blank"
            >WCAG 2.1 AA</a
        >
        for production.</li>
</ul>
